@inherits Umbraco.Web.Mvc.UmbracoViewPage

@*
    This snippet makes a breadcrumb of parents using an unordred html list.

    How it works:
    - It uses the Ancestors() method to get all parents and then generates links so the visitor can go back
    - Finally it outputs the name of the current page (without a link)
*@
@{
    var CurrentPage = UmbracoContext.PublishedRequest.PublishedContent;
}
@if (CurrentPage.Ancestors().Any())
{
    <ul class="breadcrumb">
        @* For each page in the ancestors collection which have been ordered by Level (so we start with the highest top node first) 
            Exclude the membership node *@
        @foreach (var page in CurrentPage.Ancestors().Where(x=> !x.IsDocumentType("Members")).OrderBy(x=>x.Level))
        {
            <li><a href="@page.Url()">@page.Name</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;</li>
        }

        @* Display the current page as the last item in the list *@
        <li class="active">@CurrentPage.Name</li>
    </ul>
